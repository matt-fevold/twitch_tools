A simple program to display the current playing spotify song.

Motivation - I did not want to run a large application just to run the current playing song (snip) and I wanted a bit more control over how that's displayed.

### to run:

download requirements.

Run main. Follow prompt.



### how it works:

It finds the window id for spotify (why you have to click on it, as finding the foreground window was dead simple)
 and prints off the name of that window (for spotify it conviniently is ```Song - Artist```)
